            In an interview with Vanity Fair about the third act of Downey’s

            Feige told the publication about Tony Stark’s emotional final
            moments in Avengers: Endgame. “We all worked very hard for many

          It seems difficult to imagine a Marvel universe that does not include
          Downey, but before he was cast in the crucial role of Iron Man, the
          studio was hesitant about casting him, despite Feige and director Jon
          Favreau vying for him.

          There’s nothing heroic about the final box office performance of “The

          After four weeks on the big screen, the comic book tentpole is running
          out of steam with $80 million in North America and $197 million
          globally. There would typically be optimism that attendance could
          rebound over the busy holiday season, but Disney apparently doesn’t
          expect that to be the case because it won’t be reporting the film’s
          weekend box office results any longer. The studio wrote on Sunday in a
          note to press, “With ‘The Marvels’ box office now winding down, we
          will stop weekend reporting of international/global grosses on this
          title.”

          Will Smith Gives Update on ‘I Am Legend’ Sequel With Michael B. Jordan

          Will Smith shared new details about “I Am Legend 2,” which he stars in
          and produces alongside Michael B. Jordan, on Saturday night at the Red
          Sea International Film Festival in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The upcoming
          sequel is based on the alternate ending used in the 2007
          post-apocalyptic sci-fi movie’s DVD release, rather than its
          theatrical version, in which his character dies, according to Smith
